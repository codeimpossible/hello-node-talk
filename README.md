# Hello, Node.js
A presentation about the history of nodejs and how to build a quick data-based application using sockets.

[View the presentation](http://slides.com/jaredbarboza/hello-node-js#/) at slides.com.

### Running the demo

    $ npm install
    $ node index.js

Open http://localhost:8080 in your web-browser of choice, and then have a friend open it in theirs. You should each see a blue square and a grey square.

Now use the Arrow Keys to move around the screen, you should see your friends' square move too!
